##Assignment 3-- reworking with SVG Animations

This started out as three 2D SVG shapes, but now they are dispersed to be dynamic and interactive.

No additional files includedâ€“ just SVG shapes.

**Changes made are**: 
- Made square into cubes
- Positioned shapes to be spaced out in orderly manner 
- attached CSS animations to each of the shapes, rather than as a whole
- Hover CSS activated on all four elements
- 3D aspects were included
